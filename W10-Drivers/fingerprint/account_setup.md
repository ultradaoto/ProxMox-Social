# Account Setup Guide

## Overview

Creating accounts that appear legitimate requires careful attention to
timing, data consistency, and realistic behavior patterns.

## Pre-Account Setup

### Establish Environment First

Before creating any accounts:

1. Complete all hardening scripts
2. Build some browsing history (at least 1-2 days)
3. Verify anti-detection measures are working
4. Set consistent timezone and locale

### Identity Consistency

Create a coherent persona with:
- Full name (consistent across all accounts)
- Date of birth (appropriate age)
- Location (matches timezone, IP region)
- Email address (primary and backup)
- Phone number (if needed)
- Interests/profession (for profile building)

## Email Account Creation

### Best Practices

1. **Primary Email First**
   - Gmail, Outlook, or ProtonMail
   - Use for all subsequent registrations
   - Keep login info secure

2. **During Registration**
   - Type slowly with natural pauses
   - Make and correct a minor typo
   - Take time reading terms
   - Don't rush through CAPTCHAs

3. **After Creation**
   - Send test emails
   - Subscribe to a newsletter
   - Don't immediately use for signups

### Recovery Options

- Set up recovery email/phone
- Store recovery codes securely
- Use consistent recovery info across accounts

## Social Media Accounts

### Creation Order

1. Create email first (wait 1+ days)
2. Create one social account (wait 2-3 days)
3. Add others gradually over weeks

### Profile Setup

**Do:**
- Upload a profile picture (appropriate to persona)
- Fill in bio gradually, not all at once
- Add interests over time
- Follow/friend slowly (5-10 per day max)

**Don't:**
- Complete 100% of profile immediately
- Add hundreds of connections on day one
- Use obvious stock photos
- Leave profile completely empty

### Activity Pattern

First week:
- Browse content without posting
- Like/react occasionally
- Follow a few accounts related to interests

Second week:
- Light engagement (comments, shares)
- First post (something mundane)
- Join groups relevant to persona

Ongoing:
- Regular but not constant activity
- Mix of content types
- Natural posting times

## Service Accounts

### E-commerce (Amazon, eBay, etc.)

1. Create account without immediate purchase
2. Add items to wishlist/cart first
3. Browse for several sessions before buying
4. First purchase: something small and common

### Streaming Services

1. Free trials are fine
2. Watch content before canceling trial
3. Build watch history with varied content

### Software Services

1. Download free versions first if available
2. Explore features before committing
3. Match to persona's profession/interests

## Security Considerations

### Password Management

- Use unique passwords per account
- Store in encrypted password manager
- Don't use patterns (site1Pass1, site2Pass2)

### Two-Factor Authentication

- Enable 2FA where possible
- Use authenticator app over SMS when available
- Keep backup codes secure

### Session Management

- Don't log into same account from multiple locations
- Keep sessions alive (don't log out constantly)
- Be aware of concurrent session limits

## Verification Challenges

### Phone Verification

Options:
1. Dedicated phone number for persona
2. VoIP services (some get blocked)
3. SMS verification services (use carefully)

### ID Verification

If a service requires ID:
- Strongly consider if account is necessary
- Some services may flag automation later
- Keep this persona consistent across verified accounts

### CAPTCHA Handling

- Solve manually when possible
- Take human-appropriate time
- Don't fail-retry rapidly

## Account Aging

### What It Means

Older accounts are more trusted:
- Creation date matters
- Activity over time builds trust
- Consistent usage patterns

### Strategies

1. Create accounts well before needed
2. Maintain light activity over time
3. Let cookies and sessions age naturally

## Record Keeping

### Document Everything

For each account, record:
- Service name
- Username/email
- Password (encrypted storage)
- Creation date
- Security questions/answers
- Recovery codes
- Phone number used
- Profile information

### Consistency Tracking

Create a persona document with:
- Name, DOB, location
- Email addresses
- All account usernames
- Profile photo used
- Biography variations
- Interest list

## Red Flags to Avoid

### Account Creation

- Creating multiple accounts rapidly
- Using obvious fake information
- Leaving profiles completely empty
- Immediate suspicious activity

### Account Usage

- Sudden behavioral changes
- Activity at unusual hours
- Mass following/friending
- Automation-like patterns

## Timeline Example

```
Week 1:
  Day 1-2: Browse without accounts
  Day 3: Create primary email
  Day 4-5: Light email usage
  Day 6-7: Create first social account

Week 2:
  Day 8-10: Light social browsing
  Day 11-14: Gradual engagement

Week 3:
  Create additional accounts as needed
  Continue building activity

Week 4+:
  Regular maintenance usage
  Account is now "aged"
```

## Notes

- Patience is essential - rushed accounts get flagged
- Quality over quantity - fewer good accounts beat many suspicious ones
- Stay in character - don't break from persona behavior
- Regular maintenance - accounts need ongoing activity
